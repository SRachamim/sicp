# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][SICP] (SICP) is a computer science textbook by _Massachusetts Institute of Technology_ professors [Hal Abelson] and [Gerald Jay Sussman] with Julie Sussman. It teaches fundamental principles of computer programming, including recursion, abstraction, modularity, and programming language design and implementation.

[SICP] focuses on discovering general patterns for solving specific problems, and building software systems that make use of those patterns.

## Solutions to Exercises

I first read the book a few years ago. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to revisit it and relearn things I forgot since. This repository will contain my solutions to the exercises in the book. I recommend to check them out only after solving it yourself.

## Prerequisites

[SICP] is recommended for professional programmers who are really interested in their profession. The book doesn't assume any background in computer-science, but anyone can benefit from it, even very experienced programmers. I program professionally since 2007 and still feel like learning a lot by reading the book.
